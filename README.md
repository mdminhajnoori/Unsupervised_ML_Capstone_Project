# Unsupervised_ML_Capstone_Project

🍽️ Zomato Restaurant Clustering & Sentiment Analysis (Unsupervised ML)
This project aims to extract valuable insights from Zomato restaurant data using Unsupervised Machine Learning techniques. It combines clustering analysis to segment restaurants and sentiment analysis to understand customer opinions from reviews.

🚀 Project Objectives
Cluster restaurants based on features such as rating, price range, cuisines, etc.

Analyze customer sentiments from reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP).

Discover patterns in dining preferences and recommend actionable insights.

🔧 Technologies & Libraries
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn (KMeans, PCA, Clustering)

NLTK / TextBlob for sentiment analysis

Jupyter Notebook

📊 Key Features
✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visual insights

✅ K-Means Clustering to group restaurants

✅ Dimensionality reduction using PCA

✅ Text preprocessing (stopword removal, lemmatization)

✅ Review-based sentiment classification (positive, neutral, negative)

✅ Insights to support business decisions
